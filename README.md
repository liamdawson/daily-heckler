# _Whose Turn Is It Anyway?_

![Screenshot](doc/screenshot.png)

A basic, yet stylish team rotation for your daily rituals (like standups).

## Developing

This is a "Create React App" project, packaged via Yarn.

```shell
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
Compiled successfully!

You can now view whose-turn-is-it-anyway in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
  On Your Network:  http://10.10.68.209:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build.
```

I haven't added tests. Maybe one day?

## Configuration

### src/teams.ts

```

```

## Deploying

Personally, I deploy this to Netlify. The default `netlify.toml` should work as
a new Netlify site out-of-the-box.
